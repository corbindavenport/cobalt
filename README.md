Cobalt is a lightweight operating system based on [FreeDOS](https://freedos.org/), which aims to make DOS more accessible and easier to use on modern hardware and virtual machines.

Cobalt is still very early in development, and isn't much more than FreeDOS with a custom installer at this point.

### Features

- FreeDOS 1.1 kernel
- Full compatibility with DOS applications and games
- Bootable CD with easy-to-use installer
- Weekly builds with latest packages from FreeDOS repositories

See the [GitHub issues list](https://github.com/corbindavenport/cobalt/issues) for planned features. There is no finished release yet, but you can download a nightly build to try it in a virtual machine (or burn it to a CD).
