Cobalt is a lightweight operating system based on [FreeDOS](https://freedos.org/), which aims to make DOS more accessible and easier to use on modern hardware and virtual machines. Cobalt is still _very_ early in development.

### Features

- FreeDOS Kernel Build 2040 (FreeDOS v1.1) and FreeCom 0.85a command line
- Excellent compatibility with DOS applications and games
- Bootable CD with easy-to-use installer
- Weekly experimental builds with latest packages from FreeDOS repositories

See the [GitHub issues list](https://github.com/corbindavenport/cobalt/issues) for planned features. The download link for the latest release is available below, and you can also try a [nightly build](https://github.com/corbindavenport/cobalt/releases/tag/nightly).
